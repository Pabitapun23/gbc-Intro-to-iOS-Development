This is a repository for all the iOS applications that I built during my Introduction to iOS Development course in GBC

# Projects
## 1. Session01
In this session, I learned about the basics of iOS development, like text, text field, image, padding, button, fonts, colors, alignment, navigator, editor, inspector, debugging code in simulator, contentView, SwiftUI, and many more. I also made my first iOS application. I developed a login page with images, text fields, labels, buttons, and links.


## 2. Session02
In this session, I learned more about the basics of iOS development, which include buttons, how to use built-in features from the library, VStack, HStack, forms and form validation, and error handling. I created a calculator app for calculating employee payslips.
