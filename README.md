This is a repository for all the iOS applications that I built during my Introduction to iOS Development course in GBC.

# Projects
## 1. Session01
In this session, I learned about the basics of iOS development, like text, text field, image, padding, button, fonts, colors, alignment, navigator, editor, inspector, debugging code in simulator, contentView, SwiftUI, and many more. I also made my first iOS application. I developed a login page with images, text fields, labels, buttons, and links.


## 2. Session02
In this session, I learned more about the basics of iOS development, which include buttons, how to use built-in features from the library, VStack, HStack, forms and form validation, and error handling. I created a calculator app for calculating employee payslips.

## 3. Session03
In this session, I studied about toggle (switch), stepper, slider, and date picker. Also, I learned about loops like ForEach loop and arrays. I created some applications as an exercise, like making the coffee options app that includes toggle, array, and ForEach Loop. In addition, I made a Pokemon App, that shows a list of Pokemon from the array of images.

## 4. Session04
In this session, I studied iOS architecture and lifecycle, SwiftUI, multiplatform demos (like Mac, iPad, iPhone, etc), alerts, dark mode, colors, ZStack, NavigationStack, and many more. I built a Tic-Tac-Toe game using all the specifications, and also, created a navigation bar on the top of the screen. Moreover, I downloaded and used the icons from SF Symbols.

## 5. Assignment 1
In assignment 1 of Introduction to iOS Development, I developed an iOS application for Pizza Store, named Pabita's Pizza Store. In this application, users can easily customize and place orders through a user-friendly form, specifying preferences such as pizza type, size, quantity, and coupon codes for additional discounts. Moreover, users can reset form fields using a conveniently located option on the navigation bar. An enticing feature includes the ability to explore the daily specials menu, where users can secure exclusive discount coupons. I tested and added error handling and thorough form validation to it, ensuring a seamless and error-free user experience.

## 6. Session06 - UIKitNewDemo
In this session, I learned about UI kits, the basics of storyboards, navigation, connection, and inspection in the storyboards. I made an iOS application for a pizza ordering system that has multiple screens.
