This is a repository for all the iOS applications that I built during my Introduction to iOS Development course in GBC.

# Projects
## 1. Session01
In this session, I learned about the basics of iOS development, like text, text field, image, padding, button, fonts, colors, alignment, navigator, editor, inspector, debugging code in simulator, contentView, SwiftUI, and many more. I also made my first iOS application. I developed a login page with images, text fields, labels, buttons, and links.


## 2. Session02
In this session, I learned more about the basics of iOS development, which include buttons, how to use built-in features from the library, VStack, HStack, forms and form validation, and error handling. I created a calculator app for calculating employee payslips.

## 3. Session03
In this session, I studied about toggle (switch), stepper, slider, and date picker. Also, I learned about loops like ForEach loop and arrays. I created some applications as an exercise, like making the coffee options app that includes toggle, array, and ForEach Loop. In addition, I made a Pokemon App, that shows a list of Pokemon from the array of images.

## 4. Session04
In this session, I studied iOS architecture and lifecycle, SwiftUI, multiplatform demos (like Mac, iPad, iPhone, etc), alerts, dark mode, colors, ZStack, NavigationStack, and many more. I built a Tic-Tac-Toe game using all the specifications, and also, created a navigation bar on the top of the screen. Moreover, I downloaded and used the icons from SF Symbols.

## 5. Assignment 1
In assignment 1 of Introduction to iOS Development, I developed an iOS application for Pizza Store, named Pabita's Pizza Store. In this application, users can easily customize and place orders through a user-friendly form, specifying preferences such as pizza type, size, quantity, and coupon codes for additional discounts. Moreover, users can reset form fields using a conveniently located option on the navigation bar. An enticing feature includes the ability to explore the daily specials menu, where users can secure exclusive discount coupons. I tested and added error handling and thorough form validation, ensuring a seamless and error-free user experience.

## 6. Session06 - UIKitNewDemo
In this session, I learned about UI kits, the basics of storyboards, navigation, connection, and inspection in the storyboards. I made an iOS application for a pizza ordering system with multiple screens. 

## 7. Session07 - ListDemo
In this session, I learned about Lists, CDRUD in Lists, Identifiable, Hashable, etc. I created a ListDemo app that shows the list of books and also navigates to its detailed page view. Moreover, I learned and practiced about adding multiple languages to the application.

## 8. Session08 - MultiScreenDemo
In this session, I learned and practiced about multiple screens on iOS apps, NavigationStack, NavigationView, Observable, ObservedObject, EnvironmentObject, Published, sending and passing data to multiple screens, the bottom navigation tab, and many more. I developed an app called MultiScreenDemo, where users can log in with their credentials, view the dashboard, and navigate to multiple screens while sending and passing data to each page. 

## 9. Session09 - JobsWebServiceDemo
In this session, I learned about APIs, and how to handle and integrate them in our project. I created an app called JobsWebServiceDemo, which shows a list of jobs with images, titles, and descriptions. All the data I used were from API calls. Also, in this app, I included a filtering and searching system, and a detailed page to view the details of that particular job.

## 10. Pabita_Flights
This is an iOS application that I've developed for my final exam. This is an app that focuses on flight management systems. In this app, users can book a flight, check a flight detail after selecting arriving flights, can use coupons for extra discounts. Also, users can view the list of their flight history and details of their booked flights.
